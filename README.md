## About
This is a Template for programing projects in FTC built by Gavin Rappleye and
William Finch on Teams 12889 the wyverns and Team 10523 the dragons

### Contents
  This repo contains features to get a head start on coding.
  There is drivetrain support for the following drivetrains:
- Mechanum
- 6 wheel

This code currently works with our practice bots; if you want to use it you
need to set hardware mapping and reverse motors when needed.
